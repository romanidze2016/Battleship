# Battlship

A battleship game that I built to boost my ReactJS skills. The game allows 2 players to play on the same computer. When one player is making his move the other player is supposed to look away. Once you've made your move press done and let the other player make his. The program ensures that both players are able to play the game on the same screen without revealing their grids to each other. 

Installation:

1. Install npm on your computer
2. Install all the dependecies by running the following command in the root directory of this repo:
  npm install
3. Run the game:
  npm start
